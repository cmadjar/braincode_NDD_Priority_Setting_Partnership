# Neurodevelopmental Disorders Priority Setting Partnership

## Overview

A Priority Setting Partnership for neurodevelopmental disorders was started between the Ontario Brain Institute, associated members of the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders (POND) Network, and the James Lind Alliance.
This collaboration engaged the neurodevelopmental disorder community to identify questions that they think are the most important for researchers to address.
The data includes 1264 original questions submitted through a survey, 63 unanswered research questions generated from the original questions, and some de-identified respondent demographic data (i.e. type of respondent, associated diagnosis, and age range).

This project was funded by the Ontario Brain Institute.
